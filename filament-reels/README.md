# 3D Expo Filament Reels

A small model of a filament reel with a small logo.
For 3D Expo Prague 2016/05.

Note this model has one problem - ribs a rim at the bottom.

## How to obtain STL?

Open in OpenSCAD, render, export to STL.

## Logo

The source for the logo is the SVG file.

Since OpenSCAD can only import DXF, we had to export SVG to DXF. For this we can
use Inkscape + a [plugin for export to DXF](https://github.com/brad/Inkscape-OpenSCAD-DXF-Export).
